# Haskell image convultion with a kernel.
Did it for Haskell practise, shows a bunch of kernel convolutions using a list of lists to represent a matrix.   
Thanks to https://www.stackbuilders.com/tutorials/haskell/image-processing/ for showing me how to use JuicyPixels and some general Haskell questions. Very useful guide if you want to do simple image operations using JuicyPixels.

Should be straightforward to understand if you see the code and it's mostly just me messing around so no real need to . 
write more for this readme.
